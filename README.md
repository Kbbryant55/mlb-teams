This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

In order to hit the MLB_API you must create an .env file at the root of the project with


 ```
 MLB_URL=<URL>
 ```
 
 
 Given more time, I would have implemented a filter dropdown to display specific divisions and a text search filter for teams.  Also, I would have created more robust tests in Jest.
